Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming. 
A class is the basic building block in Python. 
A class creates a new type and object is an instance (or variable) of the class.
Classes provides a blueprint or a template using which objects are created.
In Python, everything is an object or an instance of some class.
For example, all integer variables that we define in our program are actually instances of class int. 
Similarly, all string variables are objects of class string.
The Python Standard Library is based on the concept of classes and objects.
